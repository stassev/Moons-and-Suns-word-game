# Moons-and-Suns-word-game
Moons and Suns is a word game similar to Bulls and Cows or Wordle. One can play any length word to try to guess a hidden word. The feedback that the player is given is only the number of exact matches (Suns) and near matches (Moons) are there between the letters of the guess and hidden word.
